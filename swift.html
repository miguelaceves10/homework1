                <h2>Swift</h2> <br />
                <p>Swift is Apple’s newest open-source programming language for iOS and OS X apps. Swift integrates Objective-C’s parameters and object-oriented model, while including an advanced compiler, debugger and framework infrastructure.</p>
                <p>It was was introduced at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The newest version which is Swift 2, was released as an open-source language in 2015.</p>
                <p>Supports ‘playgrounds,’ a feature that lets programmers experiment and see immediate results and it is an easy language to understand syntax</p>
                <p>But Swift is mainly used by developers to create apps for iOS and OS X.</p>
                <p><mark>Fun Fact:</mark> Swift was developed for 4 years in secrecy, nobody knew about it outside of Apple.</p>
                <p> Some of the major organizations that use ruby are: <b>Apple, Getty Images, Slack, Dow Jones, Playlist Media</b></p>
