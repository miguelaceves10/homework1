                <strong>What is a Programming language?</strong> <br />
                <p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.</p>
                <p>The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.”Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, like Python, Ruby, and Swift, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.</p>
